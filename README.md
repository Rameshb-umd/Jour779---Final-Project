# Search Engine's AutoSuggestions impact of Movie Piracy

Motion picture piracy is a problem that has plagued the movie industry for years. A common form of technology is taking on a new role in helping the issue to persist right underneath movie studios’ noses. In this project we aim to understand how Google and Bing perform while curbing piracy related suggestion in their search enginee algorith,

We will focus on the top 10 most pirated movies data collected by TorrentFreak. The website contains an RSS feed with data that we can use on python to help further our experiment. To help this story become even more newsworthy, we aim to link data showing how much movies are pirated with data that shows how much revenue is lost by creators due to piracy. In each respective search, we want to see which search terms relate to illegal piracy and which search terms relate to reviews. 

It is possible that some of the algorithmic changes have affected the results seen in autosuggestions as well. In 2014, Google received millions of copyright complaints from content creators to remove certain search results. But we also believe that sense of urgency from a user’s perspective is also a determining factor which we hope to be able to experiment with during the execution of our project. 


Movie_Auto_Suggestion_Project.py.ipynb contains the full code for the analysis. To reproduce the result

> 1. edit the file final/Torrentfreak_april_16.csv file 
> 2. update the file name in the code at cell 4,
> 3. Update the output folder in the code at cell 2.
> 4. Run all cells
> 5. output can be viewed as plots in ipython.

Repeat the process for mutiple days or weeks and compare the graphs. 
Currently there is limit of 50+ graph per day for my account in plot.ly

Save the graph for comparison.
